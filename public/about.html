<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I began my journey in design with a degree in Civil Engineering in Korea, where I honed my skills in creating precise, user-centric solutions. My experience with AutoCAD taught me the importance of structure and attention to detail, both of which are fundamental to crafting effective digital interfaces. <br>
<br> 
After graduation, I had the chance to run a coffee shop in Seoul, which deepened my understanding of human behaviour. Engaging with customers daily helped me develop a strong sense of empathy and an ability to anticipate needs — qualities that are essential in UX/UI design. <br>
<br>
My passion for effective communication led me to pursue a master’s degree in Interpretation and Translation in Australia. This experience taught me how to convey complex ideas clearly, much like how UX/UI design strives to create intuitive and seamless user experiences. <br>
<br>
Discovering UX/UI design felt like the perfect blend of my skills in design, empathy, and communication. I have since completed a UX bootcamp, where I learned to create intuitive interfaces grounded in user research. Additionally, I am teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to better collaborate with developers and bring my designs to life. <br>
<br>
I am excited to bring my diverse background and unique perspective to the world of UX/UI design, creating solutions that truly resonate with users.</p>
